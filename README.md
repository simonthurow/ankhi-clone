# 2Remember(anki-clone)

This is a small anki like web application allowing users to learn through index cards by creating decks and corresponding cards in those decks.
The user can:
- Create Decks
- Search for decks
- start decks
- flip through all index cards from a deck
- change decks title
- go into deck settings where:
- - the user can see all cards
- -  delte cards
- - add new cards
- - delete the entire deck

This is my first web application and also the first time i build a somewhat bigger project using HTML, CSS, JS and React so please excuse any weird code segments or security vulnerabilities
this is only a personal project and a "proof of concept".
